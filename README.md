Though there is a much higher number of males that use the bike share, both male and female have similar duration peaks and the majority use them under an hour.

4. **Trips by Weekday by Hour:**

This heat map shows that there are more users between the hours of 6AM to 9AM and 4PM to 7PM during the weekdays with the exception of Wednesday evening.
Users also increase between 10AM to 6PM on weekends.

5. **Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour):**

This heat map provides the same results as Trips by Weekday by Hour and shows that it does not differ by gender.

6. **User Trips by Gender by Weekday:**

This graph provides insight that the younger the user, the longer the duration of the the trips.



### Summary:
*The visualizations provided several insights:*
1. Bike sharing is male dominated. How can the business become more accessible to those of other genders?
2. The bikes are generally used for under an hour and most often for 5 minutes. This concludes either that they are mainly used for commuting and not for leisure or that the bicycles are often broken. What can the business do to support these commutors in the short distances and/or passively advertise to other commutors? Can the business advance more leisure use? Is there a way to indicate that the bike is in need of repair?
3. The peak times of use differ between weekdays and weekends. How can the business ensure these hours are supported, possibly by increased technical help at these times or by adjusting prices to meet needs?

**Additional Visualizations:**
1. The start and end locations by gender may provide insight into where non-male users could be supported.
2. The start and end location of all 5 minute and under rides, and how many are of the same location to provide insight into whether their are unreported bikes in need of repair.
